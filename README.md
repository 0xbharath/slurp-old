### Features
- Written in Go:
    - It's faster than python
    - No dependency hell and version locks (ie python 3 and requirements.txt, etc)
    - Better concurrency
    - Static binary that you can use on any ELF64 linux
- Manual mode so that you can test individual domains.
- Certstream mode so that you can enumerate s3 buckets in real time.
- Colorized output for visual grep ;)
- Currently generates over 400 permutations per domain
- `StoreInDB` which will eventually be used to push data to a database

## Usage
- `slurp domain --domain google.com` will enumerate the S3 domains for a specific target.
- `slurp certstream` will follow certstream and enumerate S3 buckets from each domain.

## Installation
- Download from Releases section, or build yourself with `go build`.
